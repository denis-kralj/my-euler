# my-euler
My take on the problems contained on the projecteuler.net website

The idea is to let the project grow naturally. I want to create classes and projects as they are needed. The target goal of this whole project is manifold:
 - getting used to using git in development, and using it within Visual Studio
 - developing a sense of organization in regards to my codebase
 - learning new mathematical concepts via PE problem site
